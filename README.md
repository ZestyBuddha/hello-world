# hello-world
First Repository

Just trying to figure this stuff out at this point. This (GitHub) seems like it will be a valuable resource to store and edit code and build, and eventually work with others on projects. 

I'm pretty new at all this, and it is Christmas Day 2021, and here I am, working on this, because I find it interesting and can't quite put it down. 

I'm interested to see where all this leads.
